# <u>Design Brief</u>

I want the page to flow seamlessly from top to bottom, but still have separate 'page' elements, so you can scroll down the whole thing and see animations and images but also useable links straight to my work history/skills, and contact info.

I imagine rounded edges and reasonably translucent buttons. Not iOS round maybe more windows XP, or youtube/amazon prime video. And translucent enough to be noticeable that there's a button, but not be an obvious __THIS IS A BUTTON__

## <u>Colours</u>

___Light mode___
- I'm thinking light muted summery with one or two obvious contrasts for text.

___Dark mode___
- Bladerunner/Night City cyberpunk vibes, neons, chrome and black (this might not work)
